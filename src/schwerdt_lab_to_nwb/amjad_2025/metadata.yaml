  experiment_description:
    This experiment contains in vivo recordings of reward- and movement-related dopamine, spikes, and local field potentials
    obtained using single- and dual-channel shaft-assisted micro-invasive probes (s-µIPs) chronically implanted in the striatum
    of task-performing rhesus monkeys. The s-µIPs leverage carbon fiber materials to enable dual neurochemical and electrical
    neural activity recording at micro-invasive (10 µm) spatial footprints near the recording sites, while a wider shaft provides
    rigidity for deep brain targeting using standard cranial chambers. These probes allow for measurements from deep brain targets
    with minimal tissue disruption at the recording site. Recordings were made during performance of reward-biased eye movement
    tasks, enabling simultaneous measurement of dopamine transients, spikes, and local field potentials with micrometer spatial
    resolution. Chronic implants demonstrated stable, multi-modal neural activity measurements from micro-invasive devices over
    extended periods post-implantation.
