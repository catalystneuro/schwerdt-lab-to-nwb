  experiment_description: |
    This dataset contains chronic recordings of neurochemical and electrophysiological activity from two Rhesus macaques
    (Macaca mulatta) using a custom semi-sealed cranial chamber. Implanted electrodes included silica-based carbon fiber
    electrodes (sCFEs and mCFEs) for fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to measure dopamine signals, platinum-iridium
    electrodes (Pt-Es) for electrophysiological recordings, and Ag/AgCl or stainless steel wires for reference and
    ground. Electrodes were mounted on microdrives allowing precise vertical translation (127Âµm/turn, up to 15mm).
    Recordings targeted the striatum and cortical regions during a reward-modulated eye movement task.
